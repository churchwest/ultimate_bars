# Specification Quality Checklist: Ultimate Bars — Project Proposal

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-08
**Feature**: [Spec file](spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Spec references Airtable as the platform (appropriate for this project)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - **1 marker**: migration strategy (one-time vs ongoing sync)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Outstanding Clarification (1)**:
- Migration strategy needs definition before proceeding to planning phase

**Validation Status**: Spec quality is excellent. Only one clarification needed regarding migration approach.
