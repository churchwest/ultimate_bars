## Project Context

### Current State (Problems)
- **Fragmented Systems**: Multiple disconnected apps and Excel files
- **Manual Workflows**: Heavy reliance on manual data entry and management
- **Limited Visibility**: Difficult to get business insights and reports
- **Time Drain**: Travis spends too much time on administrative tasks vs growth activities

### Desired State (Goals)
- **Centralized Platform**: Single source of truth in Airtable
- **Automation**: Business processes run more on autopilot
- **Scalability**: Infrastructure that can support growth
- **Free Time**: Travis can focus on other projects and strategic work
- **Future Potential**: API integration for custom automation with 3rd party developers

### Why Airtable?
- Open and customizable database scheme
- Moves beyond Excel limitations
- Built-in automation capabilities
- API integration potential
- Travis wants to learn the platform
- Partner opportunity for ongoing development

## Project Scope

### Implementation Partner Role
- Help Travis get set up with Airtable
- Migrate data from Excel and disconnected systems
- Design base structure and relationships
- Implement initial automations
- Provide training and documentation
- Establish foundation for future automation

### Key Deliverables
1. Data migration from existing systems
2. Airtable base structure (tables, fields, relationships)
3. Automated workflows (inventory, events, invoicing)
4. Dashboard views for business metrics
5. Training and documentation
6. API integration documentation for future development

## Open Questions & Clarifications Needed

### Migration Strategy
- **NEEDS CLARIFICATION**: Is this a one-time migration or ongoing sync with existing Excel files?
  - **Option A**: One-time cutover (Travis stops using Excel after migration)
  - **Option B**: Ongoing sync (maintain both systems during transition)
  - **Option C**: Phased migration (migrate one business area at a time)

### Current System Inventory
- Which specific apps and systems are currently in use?
- What Excel files exist and what data do they contain?
- Are there any existing integrations or dependencies?
- Who else (if anyone) accesses this data?

### Airtable Subscription
- What tier of Airtable is Travis planning to use?
- Does he already have an account or need to set one up?
- Budget constraints for ongoing subscription costs?

### Timeline & Resources
- What's the target timeline for implementation?
- How much time can Travis dedicate to training and transition?
- Are there busy seasons that should be avoided?

## Technical Considerations

### Data Entities (Preliminary)
- Customers/Clients
- Orders/Bookings
- Inventory (bartops, equipment, event kits)
- Events (scheduled services)
- Invoices/Billing
- Staff/Resources (if applicable)

### Automation Opportunities
- Inventory alerts (low stock notifications)
- Event reminders (upcoming bookings)
- Invoice generation (automated after delivery)
- Order status tracking
- Customer follow-ups

### Integration Points
- Future API automation with dev partners
- Possible accounting software integration
- Email/notification systems
- Calendar integration for events

---

## Next Steps

1. **Discovery Session**: Meet with Travis to inventory current systems
2. **Data Audit**: Review Excel files and identify data structure
3. **Process Mapping**: Document current workflows and pain points
4. **Prototype**: Create sample Airtable base for review
5. **Migration Plan**: Define strategy and timeline
6. **Training Schedule**: Plan hands-on sessions with Travis
